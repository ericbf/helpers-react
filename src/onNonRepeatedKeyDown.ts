 * Use this to respond to only the first keydown until the key is released. Natively the keydown event is repeated over and over until the user releases the key. It's a little silly there isn't a non-repeated option. This has an issue with the meta key, which prevents keyup from being fired. So if you release meta, we will clear all key downs, so it may result in duplication.
